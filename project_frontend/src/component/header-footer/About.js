            IACSD Akurdi is an Authorized Training Centre of C-DAC ACTS Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)
             is the premier R&D organization of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)
              for carrying out R&D in IT, Electronics and associated areas. Different areas of C-DAC, 
              had originated at different times, many of which came out as a result of identification of opportunities.</p>
